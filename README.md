# Shuffler

An auxiliary app that allows you to freely shuffle your Spotify playlists and add them to your Spotify Queue.

## Getting Started

API app credentials are read from `assets/APICredentials.json`. Before running the app make sure to create this file in the following format;

```json
{
    "clientId": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    "clientSecret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
}
```

You can then run the app just like any other flutter app
